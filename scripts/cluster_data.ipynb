These gravitational waves are minute disturbances of space itself, which can arise from distant and massive but compact bodies, such as black holes and neutron stars. Now that these ghostly waves have been detected by the LIGO and Virgo interferometers, physicists and astronomers are confirming Einstein's predictions (as usual), while probing some of the most exotic phenomena in the Universe.

Women and men alike are generally raised in households and local contexts where men play an outsized role in shaping norms and wield a disproportionate amount of physical, economic, and social power, influencing the development of attitudes toward gendered policies. Across two national surveys, we look at the influence of various local institutions on attitudes toward gendered policies and find that family norms play a uniquely important role. In a follow-up survey experiment conducted on a national probability sample of American teenagers, we show that thinking of a single family member with liberal or conservative attitudes towards gender can shape teenage support for gender-related polici...\\nWhere:Virtual\\nWhen:Wednesday 12\\nSponsors:Department of Political Science, Center for Political Studies - Institute for Social Research, American Institutions Group (AIG)'\n",

However, confidently assigned aroid fossils before the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction are ...\\nWhere:1100 North University Building\\nWhen:Friday 15\\nSponsors:Earth and Environmental Sciences'\n",
      " 'Lecture / Discussion:Smith Lecture: Human evolution in South Africa: carbonates, chronologies and decolonisation: Robyn Pickering, University of Capetown\\nSouth Africa has an extraordinary record of human evolution. Knowing how old sites are is a critical piece of the puzzle and my own work has focused on adapting the U-series chronometer to be applicable to a range of South African sites of varying ages. In the Cradle of Humankind, fossil bearing sediments are interbedded with speleothems. U-Pb dating of these flowstones provides the first direct chronology for this region, allows for different fossil beds to be correlated and suggests a palaeoenvironmental control over the nature of cave deposits. After a well over a decade of research, it is possible to interrogate this U-Pb speleothem database to access factors controlling age quality, ranging from diagenesis to initial Pb conditions. Human evolution research in South Africa has recei...\\nWhere:Virtual\\nWhen:Friday 10\\nSponsors:Earth and Environmental Sciences'\n",
      " 'Lecture / Discussion:Smith Lecture - Dr. Naomi Levin, University of Michigan: Hotter, grassier and more arid? Landscape response to climate change over the past 5 million years in eastern Africa\\nLinking human evolution to environmental change is nearly as old as the concept of evolution. As soon as fossils of early humans were identified, questions were posed about how they fit into a story of changing vegetation and climate. Did human evolution occur amidst a backdrop of (or in part because of) expanding grasses and the development of hot, arid environments? Answering these questions rigorously requires many different types of data on a range of spatial and temporal scales. The collective communities of paleoanthropologists, paleontologists, archaeologists, geologists, ecologists, and climate scientists have made huge strides in addressing these questions in the past 25 years. Among the many data types used, the stable isotope composition of soil carbonates and mammal teeth ha...\\nWhere:1100 North University Building\\nWhen:Friday 15\\nSponsors:Earth and Environmental Sciences']\n",

Green, Geosciences and Engineering Division, Southwest Research Institute\\nHorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) have revolutionized hydrocarbon extraction from gas shale and tight geologic formations. In excess of five million gallons of water can be used to frack a single horizontal well with significant water returning to the surface as flowback and produced water. This returned water has poor quality. While recycling and reuse of waste water are actively pursued as preferred alternatives, deep-well injection remains the most common means to dispose of flowback and produced water. Unsurprisingly, disposal of waste fluids poses the greatest threat to groundwater when fracking a well. The technology used to dispose fluid by deep-well injection has remained the same for decades and has not been updated to reflect either the significant ...\\nWhere:1100 North University Building\\nWhen:Friday 15\\nSponsors:Earth and Environmental Sciences'\n",

Anthropogenic environmental changes are already altering or predicted to alter the relative strength of N cycling processes and the balance between bioavailable N inputs and losses in oceans, rivers, and lakes.

The grades were influenced by the presence of minority racial groups, immigrants, and residents with lower socioeconomic statuses and, even though the practice was eventually outlawed, the impact on low income and underrepresented minorities is still prevalent today. This study was designed to assess spatial patterns and intensity of flood risk to (a) HOLC grade, (b) proximity to coastal zones, (c) intensity of vegetative cover, and (d) relationship to buried (ghost) streams and wetlands to determine which variable has the most impact on flood risk.

Our mitochondria were once free-living bacteria. Each unit of the electron transport chain that we use to breathe oxygen was borrowed from older microbial machinery. Aerobic respiration is a medley of pieces of older anaerobic respiratory pathways such as methanogenesis and denitrification.

Relative to all the absorbers of longwave radiation in the atmosphere, water vapor is responsible for an estimated 50% of the total current greenhouse effect, followed by clouds (25%), then CO2 (20%) (Schmidt et al., 2010).  Without water vapor and the other greenhouse gases, the global mean average temperature would be a frigid -15 oC. Evaporation is the link between the energy and water balances, and on an annual basis, evaporation accounts for roughly 76% of the surface radiation budget. Critical to life in many aspects, water plays a vital role in regulating the Earth’s temperature through both positive and negative feedbacks in the climate system.

Signed languages differ dramatically from spoken languages with respect to linguistic articulators and perceptual systems required for comprehension.

In addition, my work investigates domains where language interfaces with other cognitive systems, specifically motion processing, spatial cognition, and action generation.

Our experimental interface allows subjects to design a comprehensive strategy that then selects actions for them in every period. We conduct lab experiments in which subjects can adjust their strategies during a repeated game but may incur a cost for doing so. We find three main results. First, subjects learn to cooperate more when adjustments are costless than when they are costly. Second, subjects make more adjustments to their strategies when adjustments are costless, but they still make adjustments even when they are costly. Finally, we find that cooperative strategies emerge over time when adjustments are costless but not when ad...\\nWhere:North Quad\\nWhen:Monday 15\\nSponsors:Department of Economics, Ross School of Business, School of Information, Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE), Department of Economics Seminars\"\n",

We conduct a controlled human-subjects experiment where a retailer and supplier either interact through ultimatum offers or dynamically bargain over contract terms, including a wholesale price and, potentially, an order quantity.  We also manipulate whether the risk associated with unsold inventory lies with the retailer or the supplier or is endogenously determined in the bargaining process.  One key insight is that supply chain efficiency is significantly higher when the order quantity is included in the negotiation and that, contrary to the normative theory, this leads to a Pareto improvement whereby both the supplier and retailer earn hi...\\nWhere:North Quad\\nWhen:Monday 15\\nSponsors:Department of Economics, Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE), Department of Economics Seminars'\n",
      " 'Workshop / Seminar:Social, Behavioral and Experimental Economics (SBEE) Seminar: Nastiness in Groups: Julie Chytilova, Charles University, Czech Republic\\nABSTRACT:   This paper provides evidence showing that people are more prone to engage in nasty behavior, malevolently causing financial harm to other people at own costs, when they make decisions on behalf of a group rather than when making choices individually on their own. We establish this behavioral regularity in four large-scale experiments among adolescents, university students and a nationally representative sample of adults (N = 7,426). We test several potential mechanisms, and the results suggest that the “destructiveness shift” in groups is driven by lower perception of individual responsibility, in line with self-signaling models.\\r\\n\\r\\n(To attend this online event, please complete the form to receive email instructions and announcements for this and future SBEE Seminars.)\\nWhere:Virtual\\nWhen:Monday 11\\nSponsors:Department of Economics, Ross School of Business, School of Information, Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE)'\n",

In a market where students are ranked by universities based on exam scores, we use a market design approach to explore ways to reduce wasteful information acquisition, that is, to help students avoid acquiring information about their out-of-reach schools or universities. We find that, both theoretically and experimentally, a sequential serial dictatorship mechanism leads to less wasteful information acquisition and higher student welfare than a direct serial dictatorship mechanism. This is because the sequential mechanism informs students about which universities are willing to admit them, thereby directin...\\nWhere:Virtual\\nWhen:Wednesday 15\\nSponsors:Department of Economics, Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE)'\n",

In many environments, particularly in politics, message receivers engage in motivated reasoning, distorting how they process information in directions they find more attractive. This paper uses two online experiments to study what information senders choose to send to receivers on topics that evoke politically-motivated beliefs. Experiment 1, conducted using a sample of social media users, studies the effect of incentivizing senders to be perceived as truthful. These incentives cause senders to send less truthful messages. With these incentives, senders send more false information when it aligns with receivers' motivated beliefs, even controlling for receivers' curr...\\nWhere:Virtual\\nWhen:Monday 11\\nSponsors:Department of Economics, Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE)\"]\n",
